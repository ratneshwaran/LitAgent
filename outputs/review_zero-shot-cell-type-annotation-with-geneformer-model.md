arXiv, 2024, Jiabei Cheng; Jiachen Li; Kaiyuan Yang; Hongbin Shen; Ye Yuan

**TL;DR**

The remarkable success of foundation models has sparked growing interest in
their application to single-cell biology. Models like Geneformer and scGPT
promise to serve as versatile tools in this specialized field. However,
representing a cell as a sequence of genes remains an ope...

### GRIT: Graph-Regularized Logit Refinement for Zero-shot Cell Type
  Annotation

arXiv, 2025, Tianxiang Hu; Chenyi Zhou; Jiaxiang Liu; Jiongxin Wang; Ruizhe Chen; Haoxiang Xia; Gaoang Wang; Jian Wu; Zuozhu Liu

**TL;DR**

Cell type annotation is a fundamental step in the analysis of single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. In practice, human experts often rely on the
structure revealed by principal component analysis (PCA) followed by
$k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) graph construction to guide a...

**TL;DR**

The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using
sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering
regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin
accessibility data. While foundation models have achi...

### Unlocking Practical Applications in Legal Domain: Evaluation of GPT for
  Zero-Shot Semantic Annotation of Legal Texts

arXiv, 2023, Jaromir Savelka

**TL;DR**

We evaluated the capability of a state-of-the-art generative pre-trained
transformer (GPT) model to perform semantic annotation of short text snippets
(one to few sentences) coming from legal documents of various types.
Discussions of potential uses (e.g., document drafting, summ...

### One-shot and Partially-Supervised Cell Image Segmentation Using Small
  Visual Prompt

arXiv, 2023, Sota Kato; Kazuhiro Hotta

**TL;DR**

Semantic segmentation of microscopic cell images using deep learning is an
important technique, however, it requires a large number of images and ground
truth labels for training. To address the above problem, we consider an
efficient learning framework with as little data as pos...

### Few-Shot Microscopy Image Cell Segmentation

arXiv, 2020, Youssef Dawoud; Julia Hornauer; Gustavo Carneiro; Vasileios Belagiannis

**TL;DR**

Automatic cell segmentation in microscopy images works well with the support
of deep neural networks trained with full supervision. Collecting and
annotating images, though, is not a sustainable solution for every new
microscopy database and cell type. Instead, we assume that we ...
