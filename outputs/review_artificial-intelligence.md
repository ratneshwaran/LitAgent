### Artificial Intelligence Technology analysis using Artificial
  Intelligence patent through Deep Learning model and vector space model

arXiv, 2021, Yongmin Yoo; Dongjin Lim; Kyungsun Kim

**TL;DR**

Thanks to rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent
years, the current artificial intelligence technology is contributing to many
part of society. Education, environment, medical care, military, tourism,
economy, politics, etc. are having a very large impa...

**Critique**

- missing_baselines: Results do not clearly compare against established baselines. (severity: low)
- reproducibility: No mention of code/data availability or reproducibility. (severity: medium)

**Grounding quotes**

## Gaps & future work

- Few works report comparisons against strong baselines.
- Open-sourcing code and datasets
- Larger, diverse cohorts
- Robust baseline comparisons
