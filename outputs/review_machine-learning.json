      "abstract": "Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in\nvarious domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.\nHowever, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched\npotential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solutions that solve\nunique business problems is a major inhibitor to far-reaching adoption of\nmachine learning technologies. We recognize that the monolithic nature\nprevalent in today's machine learning applications stands in the way of\nefficient and cost effective customized machine learning solution development.\nIn this work we explore the benefits of modular machine learning solutions and\ndiscuss how modular machine learning solutions can overcome some of the major\nsolution engineering limitations of monolithic machine learning solutions. We\nanalyze the trade-offs between modular and monolithic machine learning\nsolutions through three deep learning problems; one text based and the two\nimage based. Our experimental results show that modular machine learning\nsolutions have a promising potential to reap the solution engineering\nadvantages of modularity while gaining performance and data advantages in a way\nthe monolithic machine learning solutions do not permit.",
