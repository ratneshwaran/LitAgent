### 2. A Machine Learning Tutorial for Operational Meteorology, Part I:
  Traditional Machine Learning

**Venue:** arXiv | **Year:** 2022 | **Authors:** Randy J. Chase, David R. Harrison, Amanda Burke et al.

**TL;DR:**

Recently, the use of machine learning in meteorology has increased greatly.
While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine
learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required
to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal i...
