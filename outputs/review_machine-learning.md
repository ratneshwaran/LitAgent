arXiv, 2023, Samiyuru Menik; Lakshmish Ramaswamy

**TL;DR**

Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in
various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses.
However, adoption of machine learning technologies has a lot of untouched
potential. Cost of developing custom machine learning solut...

**Grounding quotes**

> Machine learning technologies have demonstrated immense capabilities in
various domains. They play a key role in the success of modern businesses (abstract)

## Gaps & future work

- Few works report comparisons against strong baselines.
- Open-sourcing code and datasets
- Larger, diverse cohorts
- Robust baseline comparisons
