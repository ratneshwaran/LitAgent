      "abstract": "Healthcare in Africa is a complex issue influenced by many factors including\npoverty, lack of infrastructure, and inadequate funding. However, Artificial\nintelligence (AI) applied to healthcare, has the potential to transform\nhealthcare in Africa by improving the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis,\nenabling earlier detection of diseases, and supporting the delivery of\npersonalized medicine. This paper reviews the current state of how AI\nAlgorithms can be used to improve diagnostics, treatment, and disease\nmonitoring, as well as how AI can be used to improve access to healthcare in\nAfrica as a low-resource setting and discusses some of the critical challenges\nand opportunities for its adoption. As such, there is a need for a\nwell-coordinated effort by the governments, private sector, healthcare\nproviders, and international organizations to create sustainable AI solutions\nthat meet the unique needs of the African healthcare system.",

      "abstract": "Data are essential in developing healthcare artificial intelligence (AI)\nsystems. However, patient data collection, access, and use raise ethical\nconcerns, including informed consent, data bias, data protection and privacy,\ndata ownership, and benefit sharing. Various ethical frameworks have been\nproposed to ensure the ethical use of healthcare data and AI, however, these\nframeworks often align with Western cultural values, social norms, and\ninstitutional contexts emphasizing individual autonomy and well-being. Ethical\nguidelines must reflect political and cultural settings to account for cultural\ndiversity, inclusivity, and historical factors such as colonialism. Thus, this\npaper discusses healthcare data ethics in the AI era in Africa from the Ubuntu\nphilosophy perspective. It focuses on the contrast between individualistic and\ncommunitarian approaches to data ethics. The proposed framework could inform\nstakeholders, including AI developers, healthcare providers, the public, and\npolicy-makers about healthcare data ethical usage in AI in Africa.",

      "title": "Justice in Healthcare Artificial Intelligence in Africa",
      "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate on balancing the benefits and risks of artificial\nintelligence (AI) as AI is becoming critical to improving healthcare delivery\nand patient outcomes. Such improvements are essential in resource-constrained\nsettings where millions lack access to adequate healthcare services, such as in\nAfrica. AI in such a context can potentially improve the effectiveness,\nefficiency, and accessibility of healthcare services. Nevertheless, the\ndevelopment and use of AI-driven healthcare systems raise numerous ethical,\nlegal, and socio-economic issues. Justice is a major concern in AI that has\nimplications for amplifying social inequities. This paper discusses these\nimplications and related justice concepts such as solidarity, Common Good,\nsustainability, AI bias, and fairness. For Africa to effectively benefit from\nAI, these principles should align with the local context while balancing the\nrisks. Compared to mainstream ethical debates on justice, this perspective\noffers context-specific considerations for equitable healthcare AI development\nin Africa.",

However, security,\nexplainability, robustness, and performance optimization challenges remain\ncritical barriers to widespread adoption in clinical environments.

AFE integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI), and Permutation Combination Techniques (PCT),\nthe algorithm optimizes Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), thereby\nenhancing predictive accuracy and interpretability. The proposed method is\nvalidated across three diverse healthcare datasets using six distinct machine\nlearning algorithms, demonstrating its robustness and superiority over\nconventional feature selection techniques. The results underscore the\ntransformative potential of AFE in smart healthcare, enabling personalized and\ntransparent patient care.

Currently,\nnumerous researchers are dedicating their attention to this field, conducting\nextensive studies and constructing abundant intelligent systems.

Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive survey\nof the current progress of medical multimodal learning from the perspectives of\ndatasets, task-oriented methods, and universal foundation models. Based on\nthem, we further discuss the proposed question from five issues to explore the\nreal impacts of advanced techniques in healthcare, from data and technologies\nto performance and ethics.
