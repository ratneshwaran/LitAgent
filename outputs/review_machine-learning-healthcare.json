      "abstract": "Postoperative complications pose a significant challenge in the healthcare\nindustry, resulting in elevated healthcare expenses and prolonged hospital\nstays, and in rare instances, patient mortality. To improve patient outcomes\nand reduce healthcare costs, healthcare providers rely on various perioperative\nrisk scores to guide clinical decisions and prioritize care. In recent years,\nmachine learning techniques have shown promise in predicting postoperative\ncomplications and fatality, with deep learning models achieving remarkable\nsuccess in healthcare applications. However, research on the application of\ndeep learning models to intra-operative anesthesia management data is limited.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the performance of transformer-based models in\npredicting postoperative acute renal failure, postoperative pulmonary\ncomplications, and postoperative in-hospital mortality. We compare our method's\nperformance with state-of-the-art tabular data prediction models, including\ngradient boosting trees and sequential attention models, on a clinical dataset.\nOur results demonstrate that transformer-based models can achieve superior\nperformance in predicting postoperative complications and outperform\ntraditional machine learning models.

      "abstract": "In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has\nevolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the\nIoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning\n(ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the\ncapabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as\n\"Smart Healthcare.\" By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system\ncan help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for\npatients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a\nrange of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which\nis smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a\nsingle storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises\nconcerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration.\nFederated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a\ncentralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model.\nSimultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information,\nassuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a\ncomprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with\nfederated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to\nconstruct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a\nblockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any\nmalicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor\npatients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by\npredicting diseases.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) transforms healthcare by enabling predictive analytics,\npersonalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes. However, traditional ML\nworkflows often require specialized skills, infrastructure, and resources,\nlimiting accessibility for many healthcare professionals. This paper explores\nhow BigQuery ML Cloud service helps healthcare researchers and data analysts to\nbuild and deploy models using SQL, without need for advanced ML knowledge. Our\nresults demonstrate that the Boosted Tree model achieved the highest\nperformance among the three models making it highly effective for diabetes\nprediction. BigQuery ML directly integrates predictive analytics into their\nworkflows to inform decision-making and support patient care. We reveal this\ncapability through a case study on diabetes prediction using the Diabetes\nHealth Indicators Dataset. Our study underscores BigQuery ML's role in\ndemocratizing machine learning, enabling faster, scalable, and efficient\npredictive analytics that can directly enhance healthcare decision-making\nprocesses. This study aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning\nand practical healthcare analytics by providing detailed insights into BigQuery\nML's capabilities.
